I decide to make my first game. Long time I didn't know what should I make after HELLOWORLD! and all the basics, so as a gamer I think it the best choice. At first I will use Trevor Appleton tutorial, then I will use this knowledge to create something else. Enjoy!

Finally I get some free time to finish my current project. Huge thanks for Trevor Appleton! For a lot of useful tips and explain a lot of features I didn't understand. My first project I considered complete, and hope come back to it in the future to refactor it. Thanks for your time, advice and criticism.
